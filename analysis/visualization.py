# This module provides functions to visualize key business metrics and delivery performance.

# This function creates a heatmap showing the profitability (total revenue) for each channel and payment method combination.
# It helps business stakeholders quickly identify which channels and payment types are most profitable, using color intensity and log scaling for clarity.
# The chart is saved for reporting and displayed for interactive analysis.

    Generate a heatmap to visualize profitability by channel and payment method.

    1. Pivot the DataFrame so rows are channels and columns are payment methods.

    3. Apply log scaling to compress large outliers and handle zeros.
